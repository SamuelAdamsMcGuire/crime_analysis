# SF Crime Analysis

This project involved writing python code to download the current San Francisco crime statistics, do the pre-processing, then upload the dataframe to Postgresql for visualization with Metabase.   

## Requirements

A requirements.txt file is included. If you would like to run the program on your system please make sure to have the needed programs and modules. You will also need a database to upload the data to that is connected to Metabase to do the visualization. I included a example config file here that would have your Postgresql (or other database) connection string. 

## Usage

Feel free to use the code. You can also follow the crime statistics with my visualizations at the following link: http://3.80.241.0:3000/public/dashboard/03fe31cb-66f1-4e5f-aeb0-1e72fd42014b
The link is updated regularly with a cronjob.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. I am also very open to suggestions on how to analyze the data further.
